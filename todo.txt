-Familiarize myself with python notebooks
-Get my github thing to work

Note: Jupyter notebook command is jupyter notebook
Makefile is nmake

1 month for working out code, then more time for optimization and graphics!

Do the c myself

Todo (specific):
    Make a plummer generator
    Make vectors for posx, posy, etc. s
    Make uniform grid of particles in center of cells to avoid rounding problems
        (and also test tree function)
        Could also experiment with random distribution and plummer distribution functions 
            Hold off on plummer sphere, involves fixing angular distribution and finding velocity 
    Look up auto keyword and how to iterate over vectors nicely


Some questions that have come up:
    Security stuff (public, private, etc)
    Is unsigned long int the correct type to use? Should I have a size var at all?
    --> Might go into the particle set class
    Will C++ let me do those nice array operations with the [:] things?
    What is the permutation that numpy is doing anyway? a vector to change order
